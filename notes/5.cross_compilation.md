Another synopsis from ChatGPT

>A cross-compiler is a compiler that runs on one platform (the host platform) but generates executable code for another platform (the target platform). In other words, it's a compiler toolchain configured to produce binaries that run on a different architecture or operating system than the one it's running on.
>
>Cross-compilers are commonly used in software development when the development environment is different from the environment where the final executable will run. Some common use cases for cross-compilers include:
>
>Embedded Systems Development: Often, embedded systems use specialized architectures or microcontrollers with limited resources. Cross-compilers allow developers to write and compile code on a more powerful machine (like a PC) and then transfer the compiled binaries to the target embedded device.
>
>Cross-Platform Development: When developing software for multiple platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux), developers may use cross-compilers to generate binaries for each platform without having to switch development environments.
>
>Kernel Development: Kernel developers may use cross-compilers to build the kernel for different architectures or platforms, such as ARM, MIPS, or PowerPC, from a single development environment.
>
>Performance Optimization: Cross-compilers can be used to optimize code for specific architectures or instruction sets, allowing developers to take advantage of hardware features not available on their development machine.
>
>Cross-compilers require careful setup and configuration to ensure compatibility between the host and target platforms. They typically consist of a compiler (such as GCC or Clang), linker, assembler, and other tools necessary for building software. Additionally, developers may need to provide target-specific libraries, headers, and runtime environments to create fully functional executables for the target platform.
