CS Code Segment 
SS Stack Segment
DS Data Segment
ES Extra Segment

With segment registers and an offset we can calculate the absolute address for RAM
How to calculate the absolute offset
    Take the segment register and multiply it by 16 and add the offset
    Eg :-
        CS 0x7c0
        Ass Origin 0
        0x7c0 * 16 = 0x7c00
        0x7c00 + 0

lodsb uses DS:SI registers as segment and offset registers respectively.
